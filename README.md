# MyBasicShoppingList

A console-based Java application built to practice core software engineering fundamentals, including object-oriented design, input validation, exception handling, and file persistence. 

The program allows users to create and manage a shopping list with item priorities, prices, and quantities, calculate total cost, simulate purchases within a fixed budget, and persist data between runs using file I/O.

--- 
## Features
- Add items with name, priority, price, and quantity
- Quantity-based item model (one object per item)
- Input validation with custom exceptions
- Total cost calculation using price × quantity
- Budget-based purchase simulation
- Save/load shopping list from a text file
- Sorting items by priority

## Technologies & Concepts 
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (abstraction, inheritance, interfaces)
- Custom exceptions and input validation
- File I/O (BufferedReader / BufferedWriter)
- Collections (ArrayList)
- Basic sorting algorithms

## How to Run
1. Compile all '.java' files
2. Run 'MyShoppingList'
3. Follow the console prompts
4. Data is saved to 'shopping_list.txt'
